#    CREATE / IMPORT PUPIL
# ===========================================

# you may create / import your own pupil
# in this example, the pupil must be a 2048 x 2048 pixel FITS file, single precision floating point
# the pupil array size (2048 pix) must match the "size" parameter
# the pupil radius in this example is 400 pix, and must match beamrad/pscale
# the pupil central obstruction should match the coin parameter (0.3 in this example)
# if you wish to use your own pupil file, make sure you either match the array size and beam size (pix) of this example, or modify the size, beamrad, pscale and coin parameters according to your pupil file



# the name of the pupil file is "pup_2048.fits"

# START FOCAL PLANE MASK DESIGN
./run optsingle 200

# this command will run for a few hrs if the number of focal plane mask zones is large
# the complex amplitude response of each mask zone is computed 
# Several sub-processes are launched, each computing a subset of the total number of zones
# you can follow the progress of each subprocess in the corresponding tmux sessions
# the tmux session names are PID followed by FPMt<index>n<NBindex>
#
# as each subprocess computes zone responses, they are stored in FITS files FPMresp..._thread<index>.fits.tmp
# you can open/view these files to follow progress - each zone appears as a line, and files should fill from the bottom to the top
#
# when all threads complete, the files are merged into a single FPMresp file
